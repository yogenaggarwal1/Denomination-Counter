Project Summary :

It is the rupee note counting program. We can input the number of different currency notes and it will tell the total of all.
It also stores the previous entry you have done. It asks whether you need previous data or continue further.


Objective :

Most of the FMCG business man has a plenty of cash currency everyday, which has to be deposited in bank regularly.
To deposit cash, they have to fill a voucher in which they have to fill the number of notes and total. If anyone fill the wrong voucher, they
may face some problems.
And also, if once they deposit the money into their bank account, they have no record that how many notes were there. So, if any problem
occurs in future and they need to know the cash deposit summary, you can't do anything.

	So the objective is to :
	1. Minimize the human error, which can be happen while filling the cash voucher. 
	2. Save that time of business man which spent in using calculators.
	3. To save the cash deposit summary.

Looking Forward :

Currently, this program can save only one previous summary. I am looking forward that it should store atleast 30 days summary because problem can
happen anytime.
